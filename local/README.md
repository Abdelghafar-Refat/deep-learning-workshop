## Running the environment locally

### Package Installation

Choose the script relevant to your machine from the sections below, and then run Jupyter (or just run a Python REPL, for instance) using the instructions in the last section.

*NB:  New contributions welcome.*



#### Fedora (versions 23 &amp; 24) 
Run the ```bash``` script and follow the instructions (such as installing additional RPMs, for which you'll need ```root```):
```
./local/setup_fedora.bash 
```


#### MacOSX Darwin

Run the ```bash``` script and follow the instructions (such as installing ```brew```, etc):
```
./local/setup_mac.bash 
```



### Next Step : Running Jupyter

Once the ```setup``` runs without complaint, the Jupyter notebook server can be run using :

```
./local/run-jupyter.bash 
```
