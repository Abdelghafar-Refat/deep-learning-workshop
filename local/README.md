## Running the environment locally

### Fedora (versions 23 &amp; 24)
First, run the ```./local/setup.bash``` and follow the instructions (such as installing additional RPMs, for which you'll need ```root```):
```
./local/setup.bash 
```

Once that runs without complaint, the Jupyter notebook server can be run using :

```
./local/run-jupyter.bash 
```
