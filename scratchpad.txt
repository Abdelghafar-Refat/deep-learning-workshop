##  Workshop of 1 or 2 hours  
  Very tempting, except for the planning/time commitment
  Michal loves the idea 
    and also thinks that DeepDream is a really interesting topic
  Thumbs up from organiser on DeepLearning idea
    Not too worried about track selection, etc - all a work-in-progress


### Foundation : Python (or iPython)

Potential Toolsets : 

*  TensorFlow?  (would require more work)
*  Theano + Lasagne (standing on head)

Cannot rely on people having appropriate GPU installation (TensorFlow is particularly fussy version-wise).
Therefore, must resign ourselves to CPU-based training.



## How to implement workshop practicals


Running iPython 

*  http://blog.ouseful.info/2014/12/12/seven-ways-of-running-ipython-notebooks/
   *  http://blog.ouseful.info/2015/05/18/kiteflying-around-containers-a-better-alternative-to-course-vms/
      *  https://github.com/docker/kitematic  (docker container manager for VirtualBox VM - but Not For Linux => disqualified)

Host the VM on a central server?

*  http://lambdaops.com/ipythonjupyter-tmpnb-debuts/
  *  Problem : CPU usage is high - so 10 people logged in would probably bring a single host to its knees

Alternative : AWS GPU instance
  *  How to install Theano on Amazon EC2 GPU instances for deep learning 
     *  Has prebuilt AMI too  : The current one is ami-b141a2f5 (the updated one at the top of the post). You can always search Theano - CUDA 7 as its name.
        *  NOw : ami-1f3e225a
     *  http://markus.com/install-theano-on-aws/

  *  Requirement : g2.2xlarge On-Demand Instances
     *  g2.2xlarge : GRID K520 gpu 
     *  Pricing : 
        *             vCPU  ECU  Memory (GiB) Instance Storage (GB)  Linux/UNIX Usage
        * g2.2xlarge  8      26           15                 60 SSD    $0.65 per Hour
        * g2.8xlarge  32    104           60            2 x 120 SSD    $2.60 per Hour
        
  *  Import of existing VMs
     *  Verify that your VM satisfies the prerequisites for VM Import, prepare it for import, 
        and export it from its current environment as an OVA file (or VMDK, VHD, or RAW).
        


## Vagrant

This project provides a Ubuntu (14.04) Vagrant Virtual Machine (VM) with the TensorFlow library from Google and IPython (now know as Jupyter) notebooks using vagrant :
*  https://github.com/gavinln/tensorflow-ipy

Python-dev vagrant configuration :
*  https://github.com/AnthonyNystrom/python-dev-bootstrap

*  https://datascience.berkeley.edu/data-science-vagrant-ipython-notebook/
   *  Except that :
      *   vagrant still requires people to have VirtualBox installed.
      *   vagrant downloads 320Mb disk images - which would over-burden the network, and take 20mins
      *   ... So : Much more reasonable to distribute VirtualBox VM images on USB ...

*  Alternative : Vagrant
   *   https://developer.fedoraproject.org/tools/vagrant/vagrant-virtualbox.html
   *   https://www.vagrantup.com/        
        *   This was how the Spark environment for the edX course was done...  Perhaps the vagrant(?) files exist?


## VirtualBox images

VirtualBox images are pretty portable...

*  If we only need iPython with all the imports, don't need to worry about editor, etc
   *  could also do it without installing X - and running the browser session in the host machine...

  *  http://virtuallyhyper.com/2013/06/migrate-from-libvirt-kvm-to-virtualbox/
     *  Sadly, the virt-convert tool no longer supports the -o vmx option. 
        *   It looks like you might have to just use the old version:
     *  Might want to state right at the beginning that this requires VMware installed and isn't any use if you don't!
        *   ovftool is free, you just have to create a myVMware account. The registration for a MyVMWare account is also free, you just need a valid email address. Have you tried registering for a MyVMware account?
  *  http://it-ovid.blogspot.sg/2012/10/virtual-box-headless-cheatsheet.html
     *  Import VMWare disk images
        *   VBoxManage convertfromraw --format vmdk --variant Standard <source>.vmdk <destination>.vdi
     *  This was suggested by Kai Hendry as being very do-able
        *   Also ... VirtualBox is capable of importing and exporting virtual machines in the standard Open Virtualization Format (OVF). 
   *  [How To] Headless VirtualBox on Headless Server
      *   https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=60681
         *  Just a note: exporting a VM will change internal IDs for both the VM virtual motherboard and the disks.
         *  This will typically break a grub/fstab config in Linux and possibly trigger again activation on Windows. Copying the VM directly really is the proper way of doing it.
         *  Exporting should be a last resort thing.

        
  
Successful installers could also open up their 'server' to access via WiFi, without risk :

*  https://www.reddit.com/r/IPython/comments/3gw3e5/how_to_access_to_the_ipython_server_from_a/
  

GPU?

*  unfortunately VM solution probably doesn't allow for GPU anyway :

### Topics within Deep Learning     
#### ConvNets:

  Pros 
    More materials available
    Different angles : Art, Commerce
    Can do some simple 'real' training (MNIST)
    Can also use pre-built model (ImageNet / Inception-3)
  Cons
    'Simple stuff'
    Overlap with potential customers?
    Google DeepDreaming may not be ready : CHECK THIS
  Ideas for progression :
    Stanford Seminar - Oriol Vinyals of Google
      https://youtu.be/UAq961jQjYg

#### RNNs / NLP:

  Pros 
    More similar to current work
  Cons
    Difficult to set up satisfying motivation / experiments

#### Reinforcement Learning:

  Pros 
    Go=Sexy
    
  Cons
    Not so clearly 'deep learning'
    Very Difficult to set up satisfying motivation / experiments
    Very Difficult to set up satisfying motivation / experiments
    Someone else might do it...

docker images?  

      GPU would be tricky to use, and there's no OS-independence

        Continuous control with deep reinforcements learning. Is there plans to add this in code form. Many thanks Andrew.
