##  Workshop of 1 or 2 hours  
  Very tempting, except for the planning/time commitment
  Michal loves the idea 
    and also thinks that DeepDream is a really interesting topic
  Thumbs up from organiser on DeepLearning idea
    Not too worried about track selection, etc - all a work-in-progress


### Foundation : Python (or iPython)

Potential Toolsets : 

*  TensorFlow?  (would require more work)
*  Theano + Lasagne (standing on head)

Cannot rely on people having appropriate GPU installation (TensorFlow is particularly fussy version-wise).
Therefore, must resign ourselves to CPU-based training.



## How to implement workshop practicals

Running iPython 

*  http://blog.ouseful.info/2014/12/12/seven-ways-of-running-ipython-notebooks/
   *  http://blog.ouseful.info/2015/05/18/kiteflying-around-containers-a-better-alternative-to-course-vms/

Host the VM on a central server?

*  http://lambdaops.com/ipythonjupyter-tmpnb-debuts/
  *  Problem : CPU usage is high - so 10 people logged in would probably bring a single host to its knees


## VirtualBox images

VirtualBox images are pretty portable...

*  If we only need iPython with all the imports, don't need to worry about editor, etc
   *  could also do it without installing X - and running the browser session in the host machine...
  

*  Fedora minimal VM building : 
   *  https://developer.fedoraproject.org/tools/virt-builder/about.html
   *  http://libguestfs.org/virt-builder.1.html

   
*  Creating something bootable by VirtualBox
  *  https://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder#virtualbox-1
     * (not yet...)
  *  https://getfedora.org/en/cloud/download/index.html
     * "Base Cloud Images for Vagrant" : "VirtualBox Image"
  *  https://www.packer.io/intro/index.html
     *  OVF exports for VirtualBox?
     *  VirtualBox VDI file?
  *  http://virtuallyhyper.com/2013/06/migrate-from-libvirt-kvm-to-virtualbox/
     *  Sadly, the virt-convert tool no longer supports the -o vmx option. 
        *   It looks like you might have to just use the old version:
     *  Might want to state right at the beginning that this requires VMware installed and isn't any use if you don't!
        *   ovftool is free, you just have to create a myVMware account. The registration for a MyVMWare account is also free, you just need a valid email address. Have you tried registering for a MyVMware account?
  *  http://it-ovid.blogspot.sg/2012/10/virtual-box-headless-cheatsheet.html
     *    Import VMWare disk images
        *   VBoxManage convertfromraw --format vmdk --variant Standard <source>.vmdk <destination>.vdi
        
*  Alternative : Vagrant
   *   https://www.vagrantup.com/        
   *   This was how the Spark environment for the edX course was done...  Perhaps the vagrant(?) files exist?
        
  
Successful installers could also open up their 'server' to access via WiFi, without risk :

*  https://www.reddit.com/r/IPython/comments/3gw3e5/how_to_access_to_the_ipython_server_from_a/
  

GPU?

*  unfortunately VM solution probably doesn't allow for GPU anyway :

### Topics within Deep Learning     
#### ConvNets:

  Pros 
    More materials available
    Different angles : Art, Commerce
    Can do some simple 'real' training (MNIST)
    Can also use pre-built model (ImageNet / Inception-3)
  Cons
    'Simple stuff'
    Overlap with potential customers?
    Google DeepDreaming may not be ready : CHECK THIS
  Ideas for progression :
    Stanford Seminar - Oriol Vinyals of Google
      https://youtu.be/UAq961jQjYg

#### RNNs / NLP:

  Pros 
    More similar to current work
  Cons
    Difficult to set up satisfying motivation / experiments

#### Reinforcement Learning:

  Pros 
    Go=Sexy
    
  Cons
    Not so clearly 'deep learning'
    Very Difficult to set up satisfying motivation / experiments
    Very Difficult to set up satisfying motivation / experiments
    Someone else might do it...


## What environment to use?  

VPS?  expense...

  TensorFlow + iPython + VM

docker images?  

      GPU would be tricky to use, and there's no OS-independence
        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25185405/using-gpu-from-a-docker-container
        https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker
        
      Can run on windows (it essentially builds on top of a Virtualized Linux environment)
        https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/windows/
    
USB Live environments?

  JS in the browser :
    Pros
      CPU-only
      Single-threaded
      Avoids thumb-drive distribution
    Cons
      Not Python
      No GPU or multi-core - though this is (basically) same as with VM or docker
      Not iPython

        There is a new paper in regards to deep reinforcements learning in continous spaces by deepmind. 
        Continuous control with deep reinforcements learning. Is there plans to add this in code form. Many thanks Andrew.

Models
