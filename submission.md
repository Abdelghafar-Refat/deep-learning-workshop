## Workshop Proposal

### Title : Deep Learning Hands-on Workshop


#### Abstract of talk or project 
#
#Deep Learning is a hot topic, but it can be a little daunting to get started.  
#
#Provisional outline : 
#
#*  The workshop will start from the very basics (with a little mathematics), and quickly progress to getting hands-on with open source software (ending the first hour with training a deep network on a simple problem)
#*  The second hour will build on a much larger pre-trained model, and show participants applications in both e-commerce and generative art.  
      

### Abstract of talk or project  (UPDATED)

Deep Learning is a hot topic, but has a steep initial learning curve.  To ease the pain, the second part of this workshop will *require* participants to have VirtualBox installed on their laptops.

The workshop will start from the very basics (with a little mathematics), and quickly progress to getting hands-on with open source software including the training of a deep network on simple problems.

This will be followed by a more in-depth portion : Using a pre-built VM, participants will experiment with a much larger pre-trained model, and get an understanding of application to both e-commerce and generative art. 



### Short bio for the program : 

*  Martin has a PhD in Machine Learning, and has been an Open Source developer since 1999.  
*  After a career in finance, he decided to follow his original passion, and now works on Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence full-time.
*  Previous presentations can be found at : http://redcatlabs.com/presentations
    
Please add anything else you would like to tell us :

*  The workshop will require people to have decent laptops, with a working VirtualBox (free, Free and multi-platform) installation - because setting up Deep Learning software can be pretty painful.  Doing this via a centralized server isn't really an option, because of the processing requirement during model learning.  I'll probably lend out thumb drives with an installable VM image so that people can get up and running (say) iPython with all the right modules installed locally.




## PyCon SG 2016 (23-25 June 2016)

### Title

Deep Learning Hands-on Workshop


### Brief Description

Deep Learning is a hot topic, but has a steep initial learning curve.  To ease the pain, a pre-configured virtual machine will be handed out, so that participants can run it on their own laptops using cross-platform open-source VirtualBox.  In order to get the most out of the talk, participants should install VirtualBox on their laptops beforehand.


### Detailed Abstract

The workshop will start from the very basics (with a little mathematics), and quickly progress to getting hands-on with open source software including the training of a deep network on simple problems.

This will be followed by a more in-depth portion : Using a pre-built Virtual Machine, run within VirtualBox, participants will experiment with a much larger pre-trained model, and get an understanding of application to both e-commerce and generative art. 

While parts of this are very technical, the subject can be appreciated at different levels - and the models (inside the Virtual Machhine) are all in Jupyter (fka iPython) notebooks, making interaction straightforward.  


### Notes to reviewers

This workshop was held at FOSSASIA on 19-March-2016, and worked remarkably well (IMHO).  My guess is that the audience at PyCon would also be interested (even if they did it at FOSSASIA - which was. essentially, an alpha version that happened to work).

Since it includes a VirtualBox Appliance (a 1Gb image handed out via Thumb-drives), participants can install and play with a Deep Learning pre-configured environment (Jupyter / Python / Theano / Lasange) during the workshop.

While parts of the content are definitely at the 'experienced' end of the spectrum, the use of Jupyter notebooks to run all the code means that even non-Pythonists can click through the code, and upload new images / experiment for themselves.

This section includes an introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning : Specifically training a deep neural network to play 'Bubble Breaker' using 'Q-learning', similar in principle to Google's AlphaGo.

Ahh - now I see what happened.  

I put in a proposal for a Workshop, then someone else changed it into a talk; took off the notes section; approved it; and didn't notify me at all.

Now I see (from the schedule) that this is allocated 90 minutes, which isn't long enough to do the content in the original Abstract.  

So I've updated the abstract to reflect what will actually be talked about, and added to the description to emphasize how important having VirtualBox pre-installed is.

See you on Thursday!


## talk.js

I've created a trimmed-down example of the Javascript<->Python workbook here :

There's also the possibility of me doing another (similiar, but different) workshop for DataScience SG (http://www.meetup.com/DataScience-SG-Singapore/) sometime soon.  

For those wanting to whet their appetites with Javacript deep learning (in the browser), have a look at http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/ and http://playground.tensorflow.org/



## DataScience SG 2016 (23 July 2016)

### Title

Deep Learning Hands-on Workshop (Hard Core)


### Brief Description

Deep Learning is a hot topic, but has a steep initial learning curve.  There will be code.  Lots of code.  To ease the pain, a pre-configured virtual machine will be handed out, so that participants can run it on their own laptops using cross-platform open-source VirtualBox.  Bring a laptop with VirtualBox installed!


### Detailed Abstract

The workshop will start from the very basics (with a little mathematics), and quickly progress to getting hands-on with open source software including the training of a deep network on simple problems.

This will be followed by a more in-depth portion : Using a pre-built Virtual Machine, run within VirtualBox, participants will experiment with a much larger pre-trained models, and get an understanding of two application areas relevant to datascientists (expected to be : image classification and anamoly detection). 

While parts of this are very technical, the models (inside the Virtual Machine) are all in Jupyter (fka iPython) notebooks, making interaction straightforward.  However, participants should install VirtualBox on their laptops beforehand, or expect to be mocked...
