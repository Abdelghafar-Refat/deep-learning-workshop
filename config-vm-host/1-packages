# Fedora system packages are much faster to install from RPMs (pre-built binaries) than build/compile into a virtualenv

# virtualenv installation
#install python,python-devel,python2-virtualenv,python-pip
install python3,python3-devel,python3-virtualenv,python3-pip

# editor and git (for ?theano / ?keras repo download)
install joe,git

# For compiling parts of tornado-speedup (gcc-c++ is for theano compilation)
#   and redhat-rpm-config is to help jupyter install (see : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1527614)
install gcc,gcc-c++,redhat-rpm-config

# Super-useful
#install scipy,numpy,python-scikit-learn,python-pandas,Cython,python-pillow
#install python2-scipy,python2-numpy,python2-scikit-learn,python2-pandas,python2-Cython,python2-pillow
install python3-scipy,python3-numpy,python3-scikit-learn,python3-pandas,python3-Cython,python3-pillow

install blas-devel,lapack-devel,atlas-devel
## Not doing openblas, since atlas (with /lib64/atlas/tatlas) allows for multi-core operations

# ? python-zmq for jupyter?

# Good for iPython / Jupyter, and also hdfs support:
install graphviz,libyaml,hdf5-devel
# graphviz needed for pydot(2)

# Needed for linux dictionary (~189k words, used for RNN-Fun, for instance)
install words
