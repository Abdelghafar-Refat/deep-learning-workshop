# Fedora system packages are much faster to install from RPMs (pre-built binaries) than build/compile into a virtualenv

# virtualenv installation
install python,python-virtualenv,python-pip

# editor and git (for ?theano / ?keras repo download)
install joe,git

# For compiling parts of tornado-speedup (gcc-c++ is for theano compilation)
#   and redhat-rpm-config is to help jupyter install (see : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1527614)
install gcc,gcc-c++,python-devel,redhat-rpm-config

# Super-useful
install scipy,numpy,python-pandas,Cython,openblas-devel,python-pillow

# Good for iPython / Jupyter, and also hdfs support:
install libyaml,hdf5-devel

# And add the systemd service definition files
## TODO
