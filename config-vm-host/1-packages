# Fedora system packages are much faster to install from RPMs (pre-built binaries) than build/compile into a virtualenv

# virtualenv installation
install python,python-virtualenv,python-pip

# editor and git (for ?theano / ?keras repo download)
install joe,git

# For compiling parts of tornado-speedup (gcc-c++ is for theano compilation)
#   and redhat-rpm-config is to help jupyter install (see : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1527614)
install gcc,gcc-c++,python-devel,redhat-rpm-config

# Super-useful
install scipy,numpy,python-scikit-learn,python-pandas,Cython,blas-devel,lapack-devel,atlas-devel,python-pillow
## Not doing openblas, since atlas (with /lib64/atlas/tatlas) allows for multi-core operations

# ? python-zmq for jupyter?

# Good for iPython / Jupyter, and also hdfs support:
install graphviz,libyaml,hdf5-devel
# graphviz needed for pydot(2)

# Needed for linux dictionary (~189k words, used for RNN-Fun, for instance)
install words
