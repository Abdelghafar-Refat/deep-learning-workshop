## This is all a mystery
# Trying to follow https://theano.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install_centos6.html?highlight=blas without any evidence of speed-up


## OpenBLAS

# This "works", though no speed-up?
#ldflags = -lopenblas


## ATLAS
# Cannot find -latlas on its own : wierd path...

# This "works", though no speed-up?
#ldflags = -L/lib64/atlas -lsatlas -lgfortran 

# This "works", though no speed-up?
#ldflags = -L/lib64/atlas -ltatlas -lgfortran 
#-lf77blas 


## Magic switch?
openmp=true


## MAYBE something is clearing...  :: Ignore openblas - that seems to be a red-herring

#  i.e.  leave all the blas options blank..., just install the packages : blas-devel,lapack-devel,atlas-devel

#   and https://theano.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial/multi_cores.html?highlight=blas
