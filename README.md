# FOSSASIA 2016 : Deep Learning Workshop
## http://2016.fossasia.org/

This repo will include the source to build a VM to be used for the Workshop participants.

The VM itself will include (subject to change) : 

* iPython
  * Running as a server available to the host machine's browser
* Data
  * MNIST training and test sets
  * Trained model from one of the 'big' ImageNet winners
* Tool chain (mostly Python-oriented)
  * Theano / Lasagne
  * Tensorflow
  * (probably not Caffe)
