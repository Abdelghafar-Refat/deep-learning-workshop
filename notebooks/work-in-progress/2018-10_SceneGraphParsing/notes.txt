    ** Has potential (ideas stage)


*  Learning to match sentences with graphs
   +  Better groundtruth annotator for "Scene Graph Parsing as Dependency Parsing"
      -  Current Oracle gets only 70% F1 on the actual data
      -  Current best dependency-tree sentence parser idea -> graph gets 50%
      -  So bigger win may be in refining the annotator
